                <p>
                    I write mostly horror stories, some fantasy and something that I guess
                    can be categorised as a weird fiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I focus on writing more short stories, hope to finish a novel
                    and produce an interactive horror-game set in the remote parts of
                    Scotland.

                        typical school trip, that ends up with one dead body and something
                        else, something very hungry joining them...

                        <i><b>The Secret</b></i>, or The Secret That Binds Us Together. Margo and Chiara haven't seen
                        each other in years, but a mysterious message from Chiara makes Margo drop everything and
                        visit her in a remote part of Italy, where children start disappearing. Exactly, how they did
                        years ago in their own little town. It's a mix of cosmic and body horror, along with a story
                        about how trauma binds people together, haunts them and changes them, how sometimes it's very
                        hard to break the chain of it. The story was published in
