      <h1>Adrianna Kamińska</h1>
      <p>
        I write mostly horror stories, some fantasy and something that I guess
        can be categorised as a weird fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I focus on writing more short stories, hope to finish a novel
        and produce an interactive horror-game set in the remote parts of
        Scotland.
